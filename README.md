# RustCryptography
## DO NOT USE THIS FOR ANY SERIOUS APPLICATION
(Very Insecure) cryptographic library written in Rust. Used for study purposes, because we were bored.

### What we have already

So far, nothing, this is just set up. but we'll be updating the readme as we update the code.

### Future Plans

We still want to implement the following algorithms for cryptography:

* ECC25519
* RSA
* DES
* Triple DES

We also want to impement the following hashing algorithms:

* SHA-2 library
* MD5

### Contributors

* Bruno 'Flango' Larsen
* William Ferreira

### Helping us

If you, for some reason, decided to test the library and found problems, or just want to study some algorithms/security and notice a problem, feel free to drop an issue. When we have some code we'll decide how contributions should be made, so far we're going for an ad-hoc process.
